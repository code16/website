            Quality web and mobile development
        </x-slot:title>

        <x-paragraph>
            We build since 2007 websites and mobile apps based on open source technologies,
            with an "artisan" state of mind: a tailor-made development that allows control at all levels.
        </x-paragraph>

        <x-paragraph>
            Our customers have one thing in common: they want a solution adapted to a
            problem that is not necessarily standard, while benefiting from tools that make
            them autonomous on a daily basis.
        </x-paragraph>

        <x-paragraph>
            We are located in Strasbourg, a city on the eastern border of France,
            but we can of course work remotely.

                    We attach great<br>importance to the code

                <x-paragraph>
                    Our job is to understand a client's need, translate it into shared
                    specifications on both sides and ultimately convert it into code:
                    that's what we focus all our efforts on.
                </x-paragraph>

                <x-paragraph>
                    Experience shows us that this code, to be reliable and able to adapt to future needs,
                    must be mastered (which implies to depend only on open source projects),
                    concise (so that it remains understandable over time, and that it is simple to replace
                    if a new need is expressed), and systematically accompanied by an automated suite of unit
                    and functional tests (used at first write stage and even more after, to limit as much as possible regressions
                    over the versions).
                </x-paragraph>

                <x-paragraph>
                    These last years, our expertise is mainly focused on the
                    technologies Laravel, Vue.js, Livewire, Alpine.js, Cordova...
                    around tools like Algolia, AWS, Laravel Forge and Envoyer.

                <x-paragraph>
                    Rather than multiplying small projects and contacts, we seek to create partnerships
                    with our clients to work with them over the long term, in order to ensure
                    continuous maintenance to our software.

                <x-paragraph>
                    We massively use open source projects in our work, and we regularly contribute to the
                    code of these projects when we find some part where an improvement could be made,
                    whether by fixing a bug or adding a new functionality.

                <x-paragraph>
                    In the same spirit, we developed and maintain several open source projects, among which we should mention the content management framework Sharp:

            Sharp for Laravel

        <x-project-card.sharp>
            Sharp is a generalist and powerful platform for developing content and manage data.
            We use it in many of our projects, to offer a pleasant and powerful tool allowing to publish pages,
            images, videos of the sites as well as to manage orders, products or registrations for example.
