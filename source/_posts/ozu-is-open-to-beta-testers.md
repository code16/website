It’s been a long time coming, but Ozu is finally ready for beta testing—and we couldn’t be more excited!

## What is Ozu?

The mantra is this: **propose a nice solution to develop and maintain a static website with a dynamic content, keeping the productivity and great DX of Laravel**. In a few more words, Ozu is a Laravel package designed to help you build a static website while keeping a classic Laravel workflow (that we love) as much as possible, an infrastructure to deploy it in one click, and a nice and complete content management system to allow you (or your client) to update and publish the content of the website.

To find out a bit more, [here’s the introduction post](https://code16.fr/posts/introducing-ozu-a-static-website-deployment-solution-for-laravel-projects/) (with outdated screenshots).

## What’s in the beta?

Well, everything, but... in beta. We are looking for feedback on the whole product, so if you have a use case [now is the time to register](https://ozu.code16.fr). We will send you a link to fill a form to give us some context about your project, and we will get back to you with the beta access.

Here’s a screencast recorded a while ago (the UI has evolved since then but the spirit is still there), presenting the development process of an Ozu project: 

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em">
<iframe width="100%" height="460" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZBYZHeB67O4?si=wFbQ6tMi9CXL8Nc6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Another good resource is the readme of the `code16/ozu-client` package ([read it on GitHub](https://github.com/code16/ozu-client)) which is a good starting point; we also made our dummy test project public, [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/dvlpp/ozu-demo) (the amazing static production website of this thing [is here](https://ozu-demo.netlify.app)). 

We already shipped a few real Ozu websites in production, at Code 16, and we are quite happy with the results, and the feedback from our clients.

## What’s next?

We won’t set a release date just yet (lesson learned!), but [with Sharp 9 finally out](https://code16.fr/posts/sharp-9-built-to-last/), we’re shifting focus to Ozu. The stable version is coming soon!
